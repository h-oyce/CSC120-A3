For this assignment I worked with Juniper, Priscilla, and Lesly. Unfortunely, I wasn't able to attend TA hours, but after speaking with the others and writing some pseudocode, we were able to divide the work and come up with a plan for the assignment. My inital impressions of Java was that it's intimidating. While I have experience in Javascript, and the two languages have similar syntax, the syntax of Java was really frustrating. But after a while, I got used to the new syntax, and Java is no longer as intimidating as I had expected it to be. The concepts between Java, Python, and Javascript are all the same in terms of variables, loops, etc, but the idea of methods and classes is still a little overwhelming. There are many similarities such as Scanner in Java and input in Python, but it took a lot of research and studying the syntax to make those connections. 
What worked was using online resources to practice Java outside of the assignment. It was also really helpful to work and talk with others. When I didn't understand something, my peers helped me and gave me suggestions. What didn't work was the compenents of the assignment. While working on the homework, I kept having thoughts of "I know how to do this," or "this is how I would do it in Python," but I wouldn't be able to apply the same concept into Java. For someone who hasn't taken this course, I would recommend working with others and also practicing Java outside of the assignments to familiarize yourself with the syntax and working with OOP languages.
