- For this assignment I worked with Juniper, Priscilla, and Lesly. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend TA hours, but I was able to talk with others who had attended either office hours or TA hours, and they gave me lots of advice. Juniper attended Sunday TA hours, and we were able to implement what they learned during that time to our assignments. After speaking with my peers, we were able to work on the assignment together and gather ideas, and implement them when we worked independently.

- My inital impressions of Java was that it's intimidating. I have experience in Javascript, so a lot of the syntax for for loops and conditionals (the brackets, semicolons, etc) were really easy to use for the assignment. However, there were still a lot of things that were unfamiliar to me. For example, I wasn't particularly sure what Scanner did, or how I could use Scanner. After importing Scanner, I realized that I couldn't make an array. After a lot of research, I finally realized that I needed to use import java.* After a lot of googling, I got used to Java, and it got less intimidating.

- The programming concepts between Java, Python, and Javascript are all the same in terms of variables, loops, etc, but the idea of methods and classes is still a little overwhelming. There are many similarities such as Scanner in Java and input in Python, but it took a lot of research and studying the syntax to make those connections. 

- What worked was using online resources to practice Java outside of the assignment. It was also really helpful to work and talk with others, especially Juniper after they went to TA hours. When I didn't understand something, my peers helped me and gave me suggestions. What didn't work was the compenents of the assignment. I also asked for feedback from some of my other Computer Science major friends. A lot of them recommended adding a greeting to the chatbot, to create a more interactive chatbot. The greeting does not count toward the conversation count and is simply to greet the user, so it was difficult trying to work around that. While working on the homework, I kept having thoughts of "I know how to do this," or "this is how I would do it in Python," but I had a hard time trying to do the same concept into Java. For someone who hasn't taken this course, I would recommend working with others and also practicing Java outside of the assignments to familiarize yourself with the syntax and working with OOP languages.
