- For this assignment I worked with Lily, Priscilla, and Lesly. I attended Sunday TA hours as my VSCode was giving me issues running code. This working for a few hours, but after pulling from Github, the errors started again. I could only test code by sending it to my groupmates and asking them test it, or by using replit. 

- My inital impressions of Java was fear. The syntax looking so different really scared me. When I learned Python and R, the code never looked so complex where I couldn't at least read it. Java on the other hand, it looked basically incomprehensible at a glance. I am still struggling and a big intimidated, but I've gotten a little bit of confidence. 

- The programming concepts that I learned from Python and R are still useful within Java. General concepts such as loops and conditional statements are useful. However, I still have to wrap my head around the idea of making everything into an object and class. I find myself drawing psuedocode diagrams a lot more so I can understand what I need to do.

- What worked was using online resources to practice Java outside of the assignment. Simply googling errors and looking at other's code gave me a much better idea of how Java works. It really helped me to discuss with my group, especially since I missed such a large portion of class. They really gave me a much better launching point for coding in Java rather than me being lost on my own. They were very much willing to talk things through and explain how they think about different concepts.
